# Security Penetration Testing Report

## 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scan

### Findings (2024-03-21)

#### Moderate Severity Issues:

1. **@cypress/request <=2.88.12**
   - Vulnerability: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   - Impact: Could allow malicious requests through Cypress tests
   - Fix: Upgrade to Cypress 14.5.0

2. **brace-expansion (1.0.0 - 1.1.11 || 2.0.0 - 2.0.1)**
   - Vulnerability: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
   - Impact: Could cause server performance issues
   - Fix: Available through `npm audit fix`

3. **esbuild <=0.24.2**
   - Vulnerability: Development Server Security Issue
   - Impact: Allows any website to send requests to dev server
   - Fix: Upgrade via `npm audit fix`

4. **nanoid <3.3.8**
   - Vulnerability: Predictable ID Generation
   - Impact: Could lead to predictable IDs when given non-integer values
   - Fix: Upgrade via `npm audit fix`

### Remediation Plan

1. Run `npm audit fix` for safe upgrades
2. Test application thoroughly after dependency updates
3. Implement breaking changes (Cypress) in a separate PR

## 2. Static Code Analysis

### ESLint Security Plugin Integration

- Added `eslint-plugin-security` with recommended rules
- Configured custom security rules:
  - detect-object-injection
  - detect-non-literal-regexp
  - detect-unsafe-regex
  - detect-buffer-noassert
  - detect-eval-with-expression
  - detect-no-csrf-before-method-override
  - detect-possible-timing-attacks
  - detect-pseudoRandomBytes

### Edge Function Analysis

- Created custom security scanner (scripts/check-edge-functions.js)
- Checks for:
  - eval() usage
  - Dynamic imports
  - Unsafe regex patterns
  - Unvalidated input
  - Hardcoded secrets
  - Unsafe DOM manipulation

## 3. API Penetration Tests

### OWASP ZAP Integration

- Added automated ZAP scans in CI/CD pipeline
- Configured rules in `.zap/rules.tsv`
- Weekly scheduled scans for:
  - SQL injection
  - XSS vulnerabilities
  - CSRF issues
  - Open redirects
  - RLS policy bypass attempts

## 4. Auth & Session Tests

*Pending implementation*

## 5. Edge Function Review

*Pending security review*

## 6. Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

- Created `.github/workflows/security-checks.yml`
- Implements:
  - npm audit checks
  - OWASP dependency scanning
  - ESLint security checks
  - ZAP API scanning
  - Artifact upload for reports

### NPM Scripts

Added security-related npm scripts:
```json
{
  "security:audit": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate",
  "security:edge": "node scripts/check-edge-functions.js",
  "security:lint": "eslint . --config eslint.config.js --max-warnings 0",
  "security:all": "npm run security:audit && npm run security:edge && npm run security:lint",
  "precommit": "npm run security:all"
}
```

## 7. Next Steps

1. Run `npm audit fix` to address current vulnerabilities
2. Complete first full security scan
3. Review and triage any findings
4. Implement fixes based on priority
5. Document any accepted risks
6. Schedule regular security reviews

## 8. Continuous Monitoring

- Weekly automated scans via GitHub Actions
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Dependency monitoring through npm audit
- Regular manual security reviews
