## ðŸ”§ Required Fixes & Feature Gaps

### Forms & Modals
- [ ] Replace all basic `useState` input handling with `react-hook-form`.
- [ ] Add form validation rules to every form modal (email, required, maxLength, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure modals like `CreateLeadDialog`, `EditInvoiceDialog`, etc., perform proper Supabase mutations.

### Supabase Integration
- [ ] Ensure all components fetch from Supabase â€” NO static/mock data allowed.
- [ ] Build missing hooks for components that currently lack DB interaction.
- [ ] Confirm RLS-safe usage (`user_id` scoped, `auth.uid()` in every row insert/update).

### Error Handling
- [ ] Wrap all async Supabase calls with try/catch and toast notifications.
- [ ] Use `<GlobalErrorBoundary />` for critical modules (analytics, dashboard, settings).

### Type Safety
- [ ] Strongly type all hooks, queries, and form fields using TypeScript interfaces and enums.

### Optimistic Updates
- [ ] Refactor mutations (create, edit, delete) to use `useOptimisticUpdate`.

## ðŸ§± Structural Enhancements

- [ ] Ensure all components < 500 lines â€” split into feature modules if needed.
- [ ] Use DRY: extract reusable modal/form/layout components.

## âœ… COMPLETE WHEN:

- [ ] Every CRUD action writes to Supabase and logs to `activity_logs`
- [ ] No component contains mock/static data
- [ ] Each form is validated, typed, RLS-safe, and shows UI feedback
- [ ] All modules have live state persisted to DB
